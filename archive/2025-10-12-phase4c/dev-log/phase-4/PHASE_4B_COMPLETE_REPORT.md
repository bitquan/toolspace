- 93 orphaned files identified (mostly logs and Firebase artifacts)
- Repository structure validated as appropriate for Flutter
- Key backup files preserved (routes.dart.backup)

### üìä Objective 7: Comprehensive Reporting
**Before:**
- Fragmented progress tracking
- No unified view of Phase 4B completion

**After:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- This comprehensive before/after report
- All audit reports generated and reviewed
- Progress tracking established in `dev-log/phase-4/`

## Technical Achievements

### Route System (`core/routes.dart`)
```dart
// 23 tool routes + core + auth + billing + marketing
static const String textTools = '/tools/text-tools';
static const String fileMerger = '/tools/file-merger';
// ... all routes implemented exactly per docs/platform/routes.md
```

### Tool Implementation Matrix
| Tool | Screen | Route | Status |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| text_tools | ‚úÖ | /tools/text-tools | ‚úÖ |
| file_merger | ‚úÖ | /tools/file-merger | ‚úÖ |
| json_doctor | ‚úÖ | /tools/json-doctor | ‚úÖ |
| qr_maker | ‚úÖ | /tools/qr-maker | ‚úÖ |
| ... | ‚úÖ | ... | ‚úÖ |
| **Total: 23/23** | **‚úÖ** | **‚úÖ** | **‚úÖ** |

### Test Coverage Enhancement
- **Added:** 3 new critical test files
- **Coverage:** All major tool categories tested
- **CI Ready:** Tests integrate with existing Flutter test suite

### Cross-tool Data Sharing
```dart
// ShareBus with TTL and multi-subscriber support
ShareBus.instance.publish(ShareEnvelope(
  kind: ShareKind.json,
  value: processedData,
  meta: {'sourceToolId': 'json_doctor'}
));
```

### Billing Integration
- PaywallGuard wraps Pro tools
- Credit system integration
- Stripe webhook handlers implemented
- Quota management for heavy operations

## Code Quality Metrics

### Compilation Status
- **Routes:** Clean `dart analyze` ‚úÖ
- **Main App:** Successful integration ‚úÖ
- **Test Suite:** New tests compile ‚úÖ

### Documentation Alignment
- **Platform Routes:** 100% ‚úÖ
- **Tool Specifications:** 23/23 tools ‚úÖ
- **Billing Tiers:** Pro/Free correctly implemented ‚úÖ

### File Organization
