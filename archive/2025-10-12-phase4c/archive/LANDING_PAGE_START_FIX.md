# 🎯 Landing Page Start Fix - October 8, 2025

## Problem

User opened the app and saw:

1. ❌ App started directly on **dashboard** (tool cards), not landing page
2. ❌ No way to get back to landing page from dashboard
3. ❌ No Sign In button visible

## Root Cause Analysis

The app had **conflicting configuration** in `app_shell.dart`:

```dart
// In MaterialApp
initialRoute: '/',          // Says: start at landing page
home: const AuthGate(),     // But this FORCES start at dashboard!
```

The `AuthGate` widget was **forcing** all users to `NeoHomeScreen` (dashboard), completely bypassing the landing page route.

Additionally, there were **TWO dashboard screens**:

- `NeoHomeScreen` - The fancy animated one (actually being used)
- `HomeScreen` - Simple version (not being used)

I had added navigation buttons to the wrong one!

## Fixes Applied ✅

### Fix #1: Removed Forced Dashboard Start

**File:** `lib/app_shell.dart`

**Before:**

```dart
home: const AuthGate(),  // This forces dashboard
```

**After:**

```dart
// Removed the home property entirely
// Now initialRoute: '/' properly works
```

**Result:** App now starts at landing page (`/`) as configured in routes

---

### Fix #2: Added Navigation to Actual Dashboard

**File:** `lib/screens/neo_home_screen.dart`

**Added navigation buttons in the header row:**

```dart
// Home button - navigate to landing page
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.home_outlined),
  tooltip: 'Landing Page',
  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/'),
),

// Sign In button
TextButton.icon(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.login, size: 18),
  label: const Text('Sign In'),
  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/auth/signin'),
),
```

**Location:** Top right of dashboard, next to billing button
