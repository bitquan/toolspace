## 🚧 What's Left to Implement

### **1. E2E Testing (Priority 1 - NOW)**

**Test billing flow end-to-end:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Firebase Emulators (already running?)
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2: Stripe CLI webhook forwarding
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5001/toolspace-beta/us-central1/stripeWebhook

# Terminal 3: Run Flutter app
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Test checklist:**

- [ ] Navigate to premium tool (MD to PDF, ID Generator, etc.)
- [ ] Verify PaywallGuard shows subscription prompt
- [ ] Click "Subscribe" button
- [ ] Complete Stripe checkout with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Verify webhook event received (check Terminal 2)
- [ ] Verify subscription created in Firestore (check `localhost:4000`)
- [ ] Verify app unlocks premium tool
- [ ] Test on all 5 heavy tools with PaywallGuard:
  - [ ] MD to PDF Generator
  - [ ] Advanced ID Generator
  - [ ] Palette Extractor
  - [ ] JSON Doctor
  - [ ] Time Convert

**Expected behavior:**

- PaywallGuard blocks access initially
- Checkout flow completes successfully
- Webhook processes payment
- Firestore updates with subscription
- App unlocks immediately after payment

---

### **2. Verify PaywallGuard Integration (Priority 1)**

**Check that PaywallGuard is properly integrated:**

```bash
# Search for PaywallGuard usage
grep -r "PaywallGuard" lib/tools/
```

**Expected integrations:**

- MD to PDF screen
- ID Generator premium features
- URL Shortener premium features
- Palette Extractor
- Any other heavy computation tools

**If not integrated yet, need to wrap tool screens:**

```dart
PaywallGuard(
  feature: FeatureType.mdToPdf,
  child: YourToolScreen(),
)
```

---

### **3. Production Webhook Configuration (Priority 2 - Before Deploy)**

**When ready to deploy to production:**

1. **Add webhook in Stripe Dashboard:**

   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://us-central1-toolspace-beta.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.payment_*`
   - Copy webhook secret (`whsec_...`)

2. **Set webhook secret in Firebase:**

   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_PRODUCTION_SECRET"
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. **Test production webhook:**
   - Make real test purchase
   - Check function logs: `firebase functions:log`
   - Verify Firestore updates

---

### **4. UI Polish (Priority 3 - Optional)**

**Remaining widget test failures (31 tests):**

- Codec Lab widget tests (3)
- Password Gen widget tests (4)
- ID Gen widget tests (3)
- URL Short widget tests (10)
- Others (11)

**These are cosmetic and non-blocking.** Can fix later if time permits.

---

### **5. Documentation Updates (Priority 2)**

**Before merging to main:**

- [ ] Update README.md with deployment instructions
- [ ] Document Stripe configuration
- [ ] Add E2E test results
- [ ] Update MONETIZATION_ROADMAP.md with completion status
- [ ] Create deployment checklist

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

### **Action 1: Verify Emulators Running**

```bash
# Check if emulators are running
curl http://localhost:4000

# If not, start them:
firebase emulators:start
```

### **Action 2: Start Stripe CLI (if not running)**

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5001/toolspace-beta/us-central1/stripeWebhook
```

### **Action 3: Run Flutter App**

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### **Action 4: Manual E2E Test**

1. Open app in browser
2. Navigate to a premium tool
3. Try to access it
4. Complete subscription flow
5. Verify tool unlocks

### **Action 5: Verify with Stripe CLI**

```bash
# Trigger test events manually
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

# Check if webhook received events
```

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

### **Issue: PaywallGuard not showing**

**Fix:** Check if feature is registered in billing service

### **Issue: Checkout session fails**

**Fix:** Check Stripe keys in `lib/config/stripe_config.dart`

### **Issue: Webhook not received**

**Fix:** Verify `stripe listen` is running and forwarding to correct URL

### **Issue: Subscription not created in Firestore**

**Fix:** Check function logs for errors: `firebase functions:log`

### **Issue: Tool doesn't unlock after payment**

**Fix:** Verify subscription status listener in Flutter app
