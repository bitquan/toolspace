## 🔍 Code Quality Issues

### 🟡 Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. Deprecated API Usage (300 instances)

**Issue:** Using `.withOpacity()` instead of `.withValues()`

```dart
// Current (deprecated)
Colors.white.withOpacity(0.5)

// Should be
Colors.white.withValues(alpha: 0.5)
```

**Impact:** Low - Will continue working, just generates warnings
**Priority:** Low - Can fix in future update

#### 2. Unused Imports (2 instances)

**File:** `lib/core/routes.dart`

```dart
import '../screens/home_screen.dart';        // ← Unused
import '../screens/landing/landing_page.dart'; // ← Unused
```

**Impact:** None - Just adds few bytes to bundle
**Priority:** Low - Easy cleanup

#### 3. Unused Variables (5 instances)

- `_indentLevel` in `json_doctor_screen.dart`
- `content` in `palette_extractor_screen.dart`
- `theme` in `color_swatch_card.dart`
- `_buildSearchDialog` in `unit_converter_screen.dart`

**Impact:** None
**Priority:** Low

#### 4. Color API Deprecations (palette extractor)

Using deprecated `.red`, `.green`, `.blue` accessors
**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Medium - Should fix before major Flutter update

## 🔐 Security & Production Settings

### ✅ Ready for Production

- Firebase emulator detection (`kDebugMode` checks)
- PaywallGuard bypasses in debug only
- Upgrade sheet bypasses email verification in debug only
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase

### ⚠️ Needs Configuration

Before deploying to production, you MUST:

1. **Update Firebase Config** (`lib/firebase_options.dart`)

   - Replace emulator settings with production Firebase project
   - Ensure API keys are for production

2. **Stripe Configuration**

   - Set production Stripe keys in Firebase Functions
   - Configure webhook URL
   - Set success/cancel URLs to production domain

3. **Environment Variables**

   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (production)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (production)
   - Firebase service account (for Functions)

4. **Domain Configuration**
   - Update `baseUrl` references
   - Set up custom domain (toolz.space)
   - Configure DNS
   - Set up SSL certificate
