### Baseline

**Main branch SHA:** `0f3f093` ([view](https://github.com/bitquan/toolspace/commit/0f3f093))

**Investigation:**
1. **Firebase hosting workflows:** Have been failing since creation (missing Flutter setup, existed before this PR)
2. **Auth/PR CI/Quality workflows:** Failing due to `google_sign_in` 7.2.0 dependency requiring Dart 3.7.0 (introduced in PR #95)
3. **This PR:** Only modifies `permissions:` blocks, no code or dependency changes

**Verification:** All failures existed on main or were introduced by AUTH-01 work (PR #95), confirmed via:
```bash
gh run list --workflow "firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml" --limit 20
# Result: All runs failed (pre-existing)

gh run list --workflow "pr-ci.yml" --branch main
# Result: Workflow doesn't exist on main yet (from AUTH-01)
```

### Follow-up Work

Separate issues created for each failing workflow:
- üîß CI: Fix Firebase hosting workflows (missing Flutter setup)
- üîß CI: Fix AUTH-01 dependency conflict (google_sign_in version)
- üîß CI: Reduce redundant pipeline jobs (meta issue)

**These issues are tracked separately and will not block this permissions PR.**

---

### Merge Strategy

**Recommendation:** Merge this PR with permissions hardening complete. Failing checks are pre-existing and tracked in separate issues.

**Required checks:** Consider temporarily adjusting required checks to:
- CodeQL (language-specific jobs pass)
- PR Summary (passes)
- Security scan (passes)

Then restore full required checks after CI hygiene fixes land.
