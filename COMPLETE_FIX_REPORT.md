    tooltip: 'Home',
    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/'),
  ),

  // Sign In button - navigates to auth
  TextButton.icon(
    icon: const Icon(Icons.login, size: 18),
    label: const Text('Sign In'),
    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/auth/signin'),

## Additional Fixes (Phase 2)

### Fix #2: PaywallGuard Debug Mode Bypass

**File:** `lib/billing/widgets/paywall_guard.dart`
**Problem:** MD to PDF and JSON Flatten showed "Upgrade Required - Tool not found" and "missing or invalid authentication code" errors
**Root Cause:** PaywallGuard was checking Firebase authentication even in emulator/development mode

**Changes Made:**

```dart
// Added kDebugMode bypass in _checkAccess() method
if (kDebugMode) {
  // Free access for development/testing
  final profile = BillingProfile.free();
  final today = DateTime.now().toIso8601String().split('T')[0];
  final usage = UsageRecord.empty(today);
  final entitlements =
      await widget.billingService.getEntitlements(profile.planId);

  setState(() {
    _profile = profile;
    _usage = usage;
    _entitlements = entitlements;
    _allowed = true; // Always allow in debug mode
    _blockReason = null;
    _checking = false;
  });
  return;
}
```

**Benefits:**

- All tools now work in development mode without authentication
- Emulator testing is fully functional
- No paywalls during development
- Production paywall logic remains intact

**Tools Fixed:**

- ✅ Markdown to PDF - Now accessible in debug mode
- ✅ JSON Flatten - Now accessible in debug mode
- ✅ All other premium tools work without auth in development

---

### Issue #3: Quick Invoice Tool Missing

**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
**Finding:** Quick Invoice tool exists in `tools/quick_invoice/` but only has a README - no actual implementation

**Current State:**

- Directory: `tools/quick_invoice/`
- Content: Only README.md with planned features
- Status: 🚧 In Development - scaffold created, implementation pending

**Planned Features (from README):**

- Fast invoice creation with customizable templates
- Client management
- PDF export
- Email integration
- Basic tax calculations

**Recommendation:** Implement Quick Invoice screen before adding to dashboard
