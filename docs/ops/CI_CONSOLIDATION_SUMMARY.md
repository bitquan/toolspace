## 📋 The New 5 Workflows

### 1. `.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml`

**Fast PR Checks**

- Triggers: All PRs, pushes to `feat/**`
- Jobs: Flutter (build/analyze/test), Functions (lint/test), Security smoke
- Purpose: Core validation for every PR (fast feedback loop)
- Runtime: ~5-8 minutes

### 2. `.github/workflows/security-gates.yml`

**Full Security Suite**

- Triggers: PRs touching rules/functions/security, nightly cron, manual
- Jobs: Firestore/Storage rules tests, E2E auth/quota tests
- Purpose: Deep security validation (conditional execution)
- Runtime: ~10-15 minutes (only runs when needed)

### 3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Deployment Pipeline**

- Triggers: Push to `main` (staging), manual dispatch (production)
- Jobs: Build Flutter web, deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Purpose: Automated staging, manual production
- Runtime: ~5-7 minutes

### 4. `.github/workflows/ui-smoke.yml`

**UI Validation**

- Triggers: PRs touching `lib/**` or `test/**`
- Jobs: Widget smoke tests, optional golden tests
- Purpose: Catch UI regressions early
- Runtime: ~3-5 minutes

### 5. `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`

**Repo Cleanup**

- Triggers: Weekly cron (Sundays 3am), manual
- Jobs: Delete merged branches, prune Actions caches
- Purpose: Automated housekeeping
- Runtime: ~2-3 minutes

## ⚙️ Required Repository Settings Changes

### 🔧 Action Required: Update Branch Protection

Navigate to: **Settings → Branches → Branch protection for `main`**

#### Replace Required Status Checks

**OLD** (remove these):

- Various old workflow check names
- `quality`, `nightly-ci`, `zeta-*`, `delta-*`, etc.

**NEW** (add these 3):

1. `flutter` - from "PR CI (fast)"
2. `functions` - from "PR CI (fast)"
3. `smoke` - from "UI Smoke"

#### Optional Checks (Do NOT Require)

- `security-smoke` - informational only
- `rules-tests` - conditional (security files)
- `e2e-auth-quota` - conditional (security files)
