## Overview

A comprehensive ID generation tool supporting UUID v4, UUID v7 (timestamp-based), and NanoID with extensive customization options. Designed for developers who need unique identifiers for databases, APIs, testing, and other applications.

## Implementation Date

January 6, 2025

## Features Delivered

### Core Functionality

- **UUID v4 Generation**: RFC 4122 compliant random UUIDs
- **UUID v7 Generation**: RFC 9562 compliant timestamp-based UUIDs with sortability
- **NanoID Generation**: Compact, URL-friendly IDs with customizable size and alphabet

- **Copy Functionality**: Individual ID copy and bulk copy all
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual animations and snackbar notifications

### UUID v7 Features

- Timestamp-based generation (first 48 bits contain Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
- Naturally sortable by creation time
- Ideal for database primary keys and time-series data
- Better indexing performance compared to UUID v4
- Maintains insertion order

### NanoID Customization

#### Alphabet Presets
- **URL-Safe** (default): 64 characters (`0-9A-Za-z_-`)
- **Alphanumeric**: 62 characters (`0-9A-Za-z`)
- **Numbers**: 10 characters (`0-9`)
- **Lowercase**: 26 characters (`a-z`)
- **Uppercase**: 26 characters (`A-Z`)
- **Hexadecimal**: 16 characters (`0-9a-f`)
- **Custom**: User-defined alphabet with validation

#### Size Configuration
- Adjustable length: 8-64 characters
- Default: 21 characters
- Real-time collision probability calculator

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Created

1. **Core Logic**:
   - `lib/tools/text_tools/logic/uuid_gen.dart` (extended)
   - `lib/tools/text_tools/logic/nanoid_gen.dart` (new)

2. **UI Components**:
   - `lib/tools/id_gen/id_gen_screen.dart`

3. **Tests**:
   - `test/tools/text_tools_test.dart` (extended)
   - `test/tools/id_gen_widget_test.dart`
   - `test/tools/id_gen_integration_test.dart`

4. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/tools/id-gen.md`

#### Dependencies Added
- `nanoid2: ^1.0.1` for NanoID generation

#### UUID v7 Algorithm
```dart
1. Get current timestamp in milliseconds
2. Fill first 48 bits (6 bytes) with timestamp
3. Fill remaining 10 bytes with random data
4. Set version bits: byte[6] = (byte[6] & 0x0F) | 0x70
5. Set variant bits: byte[8] = (byte[8] & 0x3F) | 0x80
6. Format as standard UUID string
```

#### NanoID Algorithm
```dart
1. Validate alphabet (unique characters, length ≤ 256)
2. Use Random.secure() for cryptographic security
3. For each position, select random character from alphabet
4. Return generated ID string
```

### Testing

## Lessons Learned

1. **UUID v7 Adoption**: RFC 9562 (UUID v7) is relatively new but offers significant advantages for database use cases. The timestamp-based approach provides natural sorting and better indexing performance.

2. **NanoID Benefits**: NanoID offers a compelling alternative to UUIDs when size matters (URLs, QR codes, UI display) while maintaining strong collision resistance.

3. **Collision Probability Calculator**: Users appreciate visible feedback on ID safety. The probability calculator helps build confidence in chosen ID configurations.

4. **Batch Generation Value**: Supporting large batches (up to 1000 IDs) addresses real developer needs for test data generation and bulk operations.

5. **Alphabet Presets**: Pre-configured alphabets make the tool accessible while advanced users can create custom alphabets for specific requirements.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Using `Random.secure()` has minimal performance impact for practical batch sizes (< 1 second for 1000 IDs).
