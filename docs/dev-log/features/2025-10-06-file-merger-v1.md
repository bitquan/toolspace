## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (Flutter)

#### Main Screen (`lib/tools/file_merger/file_merger_screen.dart`)

```dart
class FileMergerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Core state management
  List<FileUpload> _files = [];
  bool _isUploading = false;
  bool _isMerging = false;
  String? _downloadUrl;
  QuotaStatus? _quotaStatus;

  // Integration with Firebase
  final UploadManager _uploadManager = UploadManager();
  final FirebaseFunctions _functions = FirebaseFunctions.instance;
}
```

Key features:

- State management for upload/merge operations
- Firebase Functions integration for backend processing
- File picker integration with validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Widget Components

1. **FileUploadZone** (`widgets/file_upload_zone.dart`): Drag-and-drop file selection
2. **FileList** (`widgets/file_list.dart`): Reorderable list with remove functionality
3. **QuotaBanner** (`widgets/quota_banner.dart`): Quota exceeded notifications
4. **MergeProgress** (`widgets/merge_progress.dart`): Upload and merge progress indicators

#### Upload Manager (`logic/upload_manager.dart`)

- File validation (type, size, format)
- Firebase Storage integration
- Concurrent file uploads
- Error handling and cleanup

### Backend (Firebase Functions)

#### Merge Function (`functions/src/tools/file_merger/merge_pdfs.ts`)

```typescript
export const mergePdfs = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Authentication validation
  // Quota checking and increment
  // File processing with pdf-merger-js
  // Signed URL generation
});
```

#### Quota System (`functions/src/tools/file_merger/quota.ts`)

```typescript
export const QUOTA_LIMITS = {
  FREE_MERGES: 3,
  MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: 10,
  MAX_FILES_PER_MERGE: 20,
};
```

### Navigation Integration

Updated `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`:

```dart
Tool(
  id: 'file-merger',
  name: 'File Merger',
  description: 'Merge PDFs and images into a single PDF file',
  icon: Icons.merge_type,
  screen: const FileMergerScreen(),
  color: Colors.purple,
),
```

## Testing Implementation

## Lessons Learned

### Flutter Development

- Widget composition for complex UI flows
- State management for async operations
- Error boundary patterns
- File handling best practices

### Firebase Integration

- Functions for secure server-side processing
- Storage for temporary file handling
- Authentication for user-specific features
- Firestore for quota tracking

### User Experience

- Progressive disclosure for complex features
- Non-blocking upgrade prompts
- Clear error messaging with actionable solutions
- Consistent visual design patterns

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites

- Firebase project configured
- Storage rules updated for user uploads
- Functions deployed with proper permissions
- Environment variables for webhooks

### Configuration

```yaml
# firebase.json storage rules
{
  "rules": "storage.rules"
}

# Required secrets
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: optional
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: optional
```

### Storage Rules

Updated `storage.rules` to include file merger-specific paths:

```
// File Merger: User uploads (temporary storage)
match /uploads/{userId}/{fileName} {
  allow write: if authenticated && own user && file <= 10MB && (PDF or PNG or JPEG)
  allow read, delete: if authenticated && own user
}

// File Merger: Merged output files
match /merged/{userId}/{fileName} {
  allow read, delete: if authenticated && own user
  allow write: if false  // Only backend (admin) can write
}
```

This ensures:
- Users can only upload to their own folders
- File type and size validation at storage layer
- Merged files are created securely by backend only
- Users can download and delete their own merged files

## Impact Assessment
