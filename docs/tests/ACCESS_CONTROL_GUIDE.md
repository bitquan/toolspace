# Toolspace Navigation & Access Control

## 🔓 Public Access (No Sign-In Required)

### Landing Page Routes

- ✅ **`/` (Home)** - Landing page with hero, features preview, pricing
- ✅ **`/features`** - Full features showcase page
- ✅ **`/pricing`** - Pricing tiers and subscription plans
- ✅ **`/dashboard`** - **FULL DASHBOARD ACCESS** (NeoHomeScreen with all tools)

### Why Dashboard is Public

This is intentional and a **best practice** for SaaS conversion:

1. **Try Before Buy**: Users can explore all tools without friction
2. **Reduce Signup Friction**: Only require auth when saving/syncing data
3. **Increase Conversion**: Users see value first, then sign up
4. **Competitor Advantage**: Most tool sites lock everything behind signup

## 🔐 Auth Required Routes

### Authentication Pages (Public)

- ✅ **`/auth/signin`** - Sign in form
- ✅ **`/auth/signup`** - Sign up form
- ✅ **`/auth/reset`** - Password reset

### Protected Routes (Auth Required)

- 🔒 **`/auth/verify`** - Email verification screen (only for unverified users)
- 🔒 **`/account`** - Account settings (requires authenticated user)
- 🔒 **`/billing`** - Billing management (requires authenticated user)

### Tool Routes (Currently Public)

All individual tool routes are accessible without auth:

- `/tools/text-tools`
- `/tools/file-merger`
- `/tools/json-doctor`
- `/tools/text-diff`
- `/tools/qr-maker`
- `/tools/url-short`
- `/tools/codec-lab`
- `/tools/time-convert`
- `/tools/regex-tester`
- `/tools/id-gen`
- `/tools/palette-extractor`
- `/tools/md-to-pdf`
- `/tools/csv-cleaner`
- `/tools/image-resizer`
- `/tools/password-gen`
- `/tools/json-flatten`
- `/tools/unit-converter`

## 📱 Current User Flow

### Unauthenticated User Journey

```
Landing Page (/)
  ↓
  Click "Dashboard" or any tool link
  ↓
Dashboard/Tool (fully functional)
  ↓
  Use all features locally (browser-based)
  ↓
  Optional: Click "Save to Cloud" or "Sync"
  ↓
  Redirect to /auth/signup
  ↓
  Create account
  ↓
  Back to tool with cloud features enabled
```

### Marketing Funnel

```
Landing (/)
  ↓
  Features (/features) - See what's possible
  ↓
  Pricing (/pricing) - See plans
  ↓
  Dashboard (/dashboard) - TRY IT NOW
  ↓
  Impressed? Sign Up! (/signup)
```

## 🎯 Access Control Strategy

### Current Implementation

- **Freemium Model**: All core tools are free and accessible
- **Auth Gate (AuthGate)**: Only at root `/` to check if user is signed in
- **No Route Guards**: Individual routes don't check auth status
- **Cloud Features Gated**: Saving, syncing, history require auth

### Recommended Future Enhancement

Add optional "pro" features that show upgrade prompts:

1. Unauthenticated users: All tools work, limited history
2. Free tier: Tools + cloud sync + 7-day history
3. Pro tier: Advanced features + unlimited history + priority support

## 🔄 Auth Flow Details

### Root Route Behavior (`/`)

```dart
if (settings.name == '/') {
  return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => const AuthGate());
}
```

**AuthGate Logic:**

1. Check Firebase auth state
2. If **not signed in** → Show `LandingPage`
3. If **signed in but not verified** → Show `EmailVerificationScreen`
4. If **fully authenticated** → Show `NeoHomeScreen` (dashboard)

### All Other Routes

```dart
return ToolspaceRouter.generateRoute(settings);
```

**No auth check** - routes resolve directly to their screens.
