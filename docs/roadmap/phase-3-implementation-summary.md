# Phase-3 Trio Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: Foundation Complete, Issues Created, Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 Objective

Ship three monetizable tools end-to-end with cross-tool interoperability, paywalls, quota tracking, tests, docs, and CI green:

1. **Invoice Lite** - Quick one-page invoicing with PDF & Pay Link
2. **Audio Converter** - Multi-format audio conversion with batch support
3. **File Compressor** - Image/doc compression with profile presets

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Cross-Tool Infrastructure (Foundation Layer)

Created comprehensive cross-tool data sharing system:

**Files Created:**

- `lib/shared/cross_tool/share_envelope.dart` - Data wrapper with TTL and kind metadata
- `lib/shared/cross_tool/share_bus.dart` - In-memory event bus with pub/sub pattern
- `lib/shared/cross_tool/share_intent.dart` - URL-based navigation with base64url encoding
- `lib/shared/cross_tool/handoff_store.dart` - Firestore-backed persistent storage

**Features:**

- ✅ Type-safe envelope system (text, json, fileUrl, markdown, csv, image, dataUrl)
- ✅ TTL-based expiry (default: 5 minutes)
- ✅ Event bus with ChangeNotifier for reactive UI updates
- ✅ Deep link support with encrypted intent parameters
- ✅ User-scoped Firestore persistence for cross-session handoffs
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired envelopes

**Integration with Existing:**

- Works alongside existing `SharedDataService` (backward compatible)
- Enhanced capabilities for complex data flows
- Prepared for file-based handoffs (PDF URLs, audio files, compressed archives)

### 2. Invoice Lite Models

Created data models for invoice management:

**Files Created:**

- `lib/tools/invoice_lite/models.dart`
  - `InvoiceLite` - Complete invoice with business/client info
  - `InvoiceItem` - Line item with quantity/price/totals
  - `BusinessInfo` - Persistent business details

**Features:**

- ✅ JSON serialization (fromJson/toJson)
- ✅ Calculated fields (subtotal, taxAmount, total)
- ✅ copyWith methods for immutability
- ✅ Support for tax rates, discounts, multiple currencies
- ✅ Optional fields (addresses, notes, payment terms)

### 3. GitHub Issues Created

**11 comprehensive issues** created with full acceptance criteria:

## 🤖 Auto-Branching & CI Pipeline

**Workflow:**

1. Issues labeled with `ready` trigger OPS-Gamma auto-branching
2. Branch naming: `feat/issue-{number}-{slug}` (e.g., `feat/issue-109-invoice-lite-service`)
3. GitHub Copilot coding agent implements changes
4. CI validates: preflight → PR CI → Security Gates → UI Smoke
5. Auto-merge on CI pass (if enabled)

**CI Configuration:**

- ✅ Preflight: 8 checks (Flutter analyze, test, build; Functions lint, test; Security rules)
- ✅ PR CI: Fast validation (analyze, test, build, security smoke)
- ✅ Security Gates: Full security validation with Firebase emulators
- ✅ UI Smoke: Critical UI paths verified
- ✅ Deploy: Auto-deploy to Firebase Hosting on main merge

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Cross-Tool Data Flow

```
User Action (Tool A)
    ↓
ShareBus.publish(ShareEnvelope)
    ↓
[In-Memory Queue with TTL]
    ↓
Navigate to Tool B (optional: with intent URL)
    ↓
Tool B listens to ShareBus
    ↓
ShareBus.consume() → prefill UI
    ↓
Toast: "Imported from Tool A · Undo"
```

### File-Based Handoffs

```
Tool generates file (PDF, audio, zip)
    ↓
Upload to Storage: users/{uid}/outputs/{id}
    ↓
Get signed URL (1 hour expiry)
    ↓
Publish ShareEnvelope(kind: fileUrl, value: signedUrl)
    ↓
Target tool downloads via URL
    ↓
(Optional) Save to HandoffStore for persistence
```

### Billing Gate Pattern

```
User clicks "Generate PDF"
    ↓
PaywallGuard checks plan
    ↓
Free → Show UpgradeSheet
Pro → Check quota via BillingService
    ↓
Quota available → Execute operation
    ↓
Track heavy op: BillingService.trackHeavyOp()
    ↓
Update QuotaBanner UI
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Development Flow

1. Each issue → auto-branch → implementation → tests → docs
2. PR created with CI checks
3. Manual review (optional, can be skipped with auto-merge)
4. Merge to main → auto-deploy to production

### Feature Flags

Consider adding feature flags for gradual rollout:

```dart
// In Firebase Remote Config
{
  "phase3_invoice_lite_enabled": true,
  "phase3_audio_converter_enabled": false,  // Beta testing
  "phase3_file_compressor_enabled": false   // Coming soon
}
```

### Rollout Plan

**Week 1**: Invoice Lite (Issues #109-112)

- Deploy service layer & models
- Deploy UI (hidden behind feature flag)
- Deploy backend functions
- Enable for beta users

**Week 2**: Audio & File Tools (Issues #113-114)

- Deploy both tools simultaneously
- Beta testing with Pro users

**Week 3**: Integration & Launch (Issues #115-119)

- Add routes and home grid cards
- Full cross-tool testing
- Documentation complete
- Public launch 🎉

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Monitor auto-branching**: Check if OPS-Gamma creates branches for ready-labeled issues
2. **Review first PR**: Issue #109 (Invoice Lite Service Layer) should be first
3. **Validate CI**: Ensure all checks pass on initial implementation PRs
4. **Test local**: Run `flutter run -d chrome` to verify new code compiles

### Manual Tasks (if needed)

- Configure Firebase Remote Config for feature flags
- Set up Stripe test mode webhooks
- Add pdfkit/pdfmake dependencies to functions/package.json
- Add ffmpeg-static to functions/package.json
- Create Storage bucket rules for user outputs

### Monitoring

Watch GitHub Actions for:

- Auto-branch creation events
- PR CI workflow runs
- Security Gates results
- Auto-merge completions
