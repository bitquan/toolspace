## Notes

- **labels**: Comma-separated; add `feat|fix|chore` etc.
- **tool & area**: Help auto-label; priority must match repo labels (P0-blocker, P1, P2).
- **sprint**: Controls creation: `now` = create immediately. `later|backlog` = ignore for now.
- **assignee**: Optional GitHub username like `@bitquan`.
- **epic**: Free text; generator will create/find an Epic issue labeled `type: epic` and link child issues to it.
