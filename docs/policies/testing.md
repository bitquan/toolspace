# Always-On Testing Policy

This document establishes the testing policies and procedures that must be followed at all times during development.

## Core Principles

### No Code Without Tests

- All new functionality must include appropriate tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Refactoring must maintain or improve test coverage

### Continuous Quality Assurance

- Tests run automatically on every commit
- All tests must pass before code can be merged
- Quality gates enforce minimum standards

### Fast Feedback Loops

- Unit tests complete in under 30 seconds
- Integration tests complete in under 5 minutes
- Developers get immediate feedback on failures

## Mandatory Testing Requirements

### Before Committing Code

Every developer must run these commands locally:

#### Backend Quality Check

```bash
cd functions
npm run qa  # Runs lint + typecheck + tests
```

#### Frontend Quality Check

```bash
flutter analyze  # Static analysis
flutter test     # Unit tests
```

### Commit Standards

- Commits must not break existing tests
- New features require new tests
- Test failures must be fixed before pushing

## Continuous Integration Requirements

### Automated Checks

Our CI system automatically runs:

1. **Linting**: Code style and quality checks
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation
3. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated component tests
4. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction tests
5. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection

### Branch Protection

- `main` branch requires passing CI
- Pull requests cannot be merged with failing tests
- Minimum 1 approval required for merges

### Quality Gates

All of these must pass:

- ✅ `functions`: `npm run qa` exits with code 0
- ✅ Flutter: `flutter analyze` has no issues
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- ✅ No high-severity security vulnerabilities

## Testing Standards by Component

### Firebase Functions

**Required Tests:**

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for all HTTP endpoints
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Database operation tests

**Quality Thresholds:**

- Code coverage: > 80%
- Test execution: < 30 seconds
- No TypeScript errors
- ESLint compliance

### Flutter Application

**Required Tests:**

- Widget tests for UI components
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for user flows

**Quality Thresholds:**

- Static analysis: 0 issues
- Test execution: < 60 seconds
- No compile errors

### Infrastructure

**Required Checks:**

- Configuration validation
- Security rule testing
- Deployment scripts verification

## Test Environments

### Local Development

- Use Firebase emulators for backend testing
- Use test databases and mock services
- Run subset of tests for fast feedback

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Full test suite execution
- Multiple environment testing
- Performance and load testing

### Staging Environment

- End-to-end testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance validation

## Failure Response Procedures

### Test Failures in CI

1. **Immediate Action**: Investigation begins within 2 hours
2. **Communication**: Update team on status and timeline
3. **Resolution**: Fix or revert within 4 hours
4. **Prevention**: Add tests to prevent future occurrences

### Flaky Tests

1. **Identification**: Tests that intermittently fail
2. **Quarantine**: Temporarily skip if blocking development
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis within 1 week
4. **Resolution**: Fix or remove flaky tests

### Coverage Regression

1. **Detection**: Coverage drops below threshold
2. **Analysis**: Identify which code lacks tests
3. **Remediation**: Add missing tests before merge
4. **Review**: Ensure coverage is restored

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Test Health Metrics

- Test execution time trends
- Test failure rates
- Code coverage trends
- Flaky test identification

### Quality Metrics

- Defect escape rate
- Time to detect issues
- Fix time for critical issues
- Developer productivity impact

## Developer Responsibilities

### Daily Practices

- Run tests before committing code
- Write tests for new functionality
- Fix test failures immediately
- Keep test suite fast and reliable

### Code Review Requirements

- Verify tests exist for new code
- Check test quality and coverage
- Ensure tests are maintainable
- Validate test assertions

### Documentation

- Update test documentation
- Maintain test data and fixtures
- Document testing procedures
- Share testing best practices

## Tool-Specific Policies

### Quick Invoice Tool

- Invoice generation must be tested
- Payment integration requires tests
- PDF output validation required

### Text Tools

- All text transformations tested
- Performance tests for large inputs
- Edge case testing required

### File Merger

- File processing workflows tested
- Error handling thoroughly tested
- Security validation required

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly test suite health review
- Quarterly testing policy review
- Annual testing strategy assessment

### Metrics Reporting

- Weekly test execution reports
- Monthly quality metrics
- Quarterly trend analysis

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular retrospectives on testing
- Process improvements based on metrics
- Tool and technique evaluation

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Production Issues

1. **Immediate Response**: Hotfix with minimal testing if required
2. **Follow-up**: Full test suite run within 24 hours
3. **Post-mortem**: Analysis of testing gaps
4. **Prevention**: Strengthen testing for identified gaps

### Testing Infrastructure Outages

1. **Fallback**: Manual testing procedures
2. **Communication**: Team notification of testing status
3. **Resolution**: Restore automated testing ASAP
4. **Validation**: Verify all systems working correctly

This policy ensures that quality is built into every aspect of our development process, providing confidence in our deliveries and maintaining high standards throughout the project lifecycle.
