# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach and requirements for the Toolspace project.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Quality First**: All code must pass testing before merge
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly in development
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Critical paths must be tested
- **Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

**Scope**: Individual functions, components, utilities

**Requirements**:

- All utility functions must have unit tests
- Critical business logic must have >90% coverage
- Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
- Fast execution (< 1ms per test)

**Tools**:

- Backend: Jest with TypeScript
- Frontend: Flutter's built-in test framework

### Integration Tests

**Scope**: Component interactions, API endpoints

**Requirements**:

- All API endpoints must have integration tests
- Database operations must be tested
- Authentication flows must be tested
- File upload/processing workflows must be tested

**Tools**:

- Backend: Jest with Firebase emulators
- Frontend: Flutter integration tests

### End-to-End Tests

**Scope**: Complete user workflows across the entire application

**Requirements**:

- Critical user journeys must be tested
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance benchmarks

**Tools**:

- Playwright for web testing
- Flutter driver for mobile

## Test Organization

### Backend Tests (`functions/`)

```
functions/
├── src/
│   ├── __tests__/          # Test files
│   │   ├── unit/           # Unit tests
│   │   ├── integration/    # Integration tests
│   │   └── fixtures/       # Test data
│   └── ...
├── jest.config.js          # Jest configuration
└── package.json            # Test scripts
```

### Frontend Tests (`test/`)

```
test/
├── unit/                   # Unit tests
├── integration/            # Integration tests
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests
├── fixtures/               # Test data
└── helpers/                # Test utilities
```

## Test Requirements by Area

### Authentication

- User registration flow
- Login/logout functionality
- Token refresh and expiration
- Password reset workflow
- Multi-factor authentication (when implemented)

### Tools

- Basic tool functionality
- File upload/download
- Data persistence
- Error handling
- Performance under load

### Billing

- Subscription creation/cancellation
- Payment processing
- Usage tracking
- Plan upgrades/downgrades

### Security

- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption

## Continuous Testing

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Lint all code
- Run unit tests
- Check code formatting

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Lint Phase**: ESLint, Flutter analyzer
2. **Test Phase**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Security Phase**: Vulnerability scanning
4. **Build Phase**: Compile and package
5. **Deploy Phase**: Deploy to staging/production

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass
- Code coverage > 80% for new code
- No high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures

- Use realistic but anonymized data
- Version control test datasets
- Separate test data by environment

### Database Testing

- Use Firebase emulators for integration tests
- Clean database state between tests
- Test with various data sizes

### File Testing

- Test with different file types and sizes
- Include edge cases (empty files, large files)
- Test upload/download performance

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

- API endpoint performance under load
- Database query optimization
- File processing performance
- Concurrent user scenarios

### Benchmarking

- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- File processing within acceptable limits

## Test Maintenance

### Review Process

- Tests reviewed alongside code changes
- Test failures investigated immediately
- Flaky tests fixed or removed promptly

### Test Debt

- Regular cleanup of outdated tests
- Refactor tests when code changes
- Update test documentation

## Testing Tools and Setup

### Backend Testing Setup

```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run test        # Run all tests
npm run test:unit   # Unit tests only
npm run test:int    # Integration tests only
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode for development
```

### Frontend Testing Setup

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test                    # Run all tests
flutter test test/unit/         # Unit tests only
flutter test test/integration/  # Integration tests only
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart  # E2E tests
```

### Coverage Reports

- Generated automatically in CI
- Viewable in pull request comments
- Historical coverage tracking

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Tests

- **Arrange, Act, Assert**: Clear test structure
- **Descriptive Names**: Test names explain what they verify
- **Single Responsibility**: One assertion per test when possible
- **Independent Tests**: Tests don't depend on each other

### Test Performance

- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) appropriately
- Minimize external dependencies
- Parallelize tests when possible
- Cache test fixtures and data

### Error Testing

- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify error messages and codes
- Test network failures and timeouts
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
