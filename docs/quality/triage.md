- Issues that can't be reproduced
- Issues outside project scope
- Spam or inappropriate content

### When to request more info:

- Unclear bug reports
- Missing reproduction steps
- No environment details
- Vague feature requests

### When to escalate:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Legal compliance issues
- Customer-reported revenue impact
- Repeated issues indicating systemic problems
