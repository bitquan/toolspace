# Epic Documentation

This directory contains summary documentation for completed and in-progress epics in the Toolspace project.

## Purpose

Epic documents serve as:
- **Completion Records**: Comprehensive summaries of finished multi-task initiatives
- **Implementation References**: Technical details and architecture decisions
- **Cross-References**: Links to all related code, tests, and documentation
- **Metrics Tracking**: Development effort and quality measurements

## Structure

Each epic document includes:

1. **Overview**: Epic purpose and scope
2. **Completed Tasks**: Breakdown of all implemented features
3. **Technical Architecture**: Stack and design decisions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Testing and CI integration details
5. **Files Affected**: Complete list of created/modified files
6. **Metrics**: Development time, coverage, and success criteria
7. **Future Enhancements**: Planned follow-up work
