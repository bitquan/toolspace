# AUTH-01: Production Auth, Security Rules & Billing Link

**Status:** üöß In Progress
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker for production launch)
**Epic Owner:** Platform Team
**CI Gate:** [auth-security-ok workflow](../../.github/workflows/auth-security-ok.yml)

---

## Overview

This epic tracks the implementation of production-ready authentication, security rules, and billing integration. All features in this epic are validated by the `auth-security-ok` CI workflow, which must pass before production deployment is allowed.

**Deployment Status:** üö´ **BLOCKED** until all tests pass

---

## Test Coverage

The `auth-security-ok` workflow runs **52 security tests** across 5 categories:

### 1. Security Rules Tests (32 tests)

- **Firestore Rules** (21 tests): Users, Billing, Usage, URLs collections
- **Storage Rules** (11 tests): File upload/download, size limits, temp directory isolation

### 2. Authentication E2E Tests (6 tests)

- Complete signup ‚Üí verify ‚Üí login ‚Üí logout flow
- Password reset flow
- Email verification enforcement
- Input validation (email format, password strength)

### 3. Anonymous Linking Tests (3 tests)

- Anonymous user to authenticated user UID persistence
- URL shortener data migration across linking
- Unique localStorage UID tracking

### 4. Billing Integration Tests (4 tests)

- Stripe webhook updates billing profile
- Subscription plan persists across browser sessions
- Subscription cancellation downgrades user
- Webhook signature validation

### 5. Tools Gating Tests (7 tests)

- Free tier blocked after quota exceeded (3 heavy operations/day)
- Pro tier unlimited access to heavy tools
- Quota increments correctly per operation
- Upgrade flow unlocks gated tools
- Light tools always accessible
- Daily quota reset at midnight UTC

## Success Criteria

All 52 tests in the `auth-security-ok` workflow must pass:

```bash
# Security rules tests
cd test/security && npm ci
firebase emulators:start &
npm run test:rules

# E2E tests
flutter build web --release
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/link-anon.e2e.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/billing-link.e2e.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/tools-gating.e2e.spec.ts
```

**Deployment Gate:** The `firebase-hosting-merge.yml` workflow checks that `auth-security-ok` succeeded before deploying to production.
