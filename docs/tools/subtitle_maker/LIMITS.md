> **Current Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Risk Level**: Low  
> **Performance Class**: Standard

## Overview

The Subtitle Maker tool operates within well-defined limitations to ensure reliable performance and user experience. Understanding these constraints helps users optimize their workflows and set appropriate expectations for subtitle generation capabilities.

## Input Limitations

### Text Content Constraints

#### Transcript Length Limits

```
Soft Limits (Warnings):
├── 10,000 characters    → Performance warning
