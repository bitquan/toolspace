4. **Adjust Flags**: Toggle regex flags to modify matching behavior
5. **Explore Library**: Browse presets for common patterns and use cases

### Pattern Development Workflow

#### Starting from Scratch

1. Begin with a simple pattern and test with known examples
2. Add complexity incrementally, testing each addition
3. Use the preset library for inspiration and starting points
4. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
5. Optimize for performance once functionality is confirmed

#### Using Presets

1. Click the library icon to open the pattern browser
2. Browse categories to find relevant patterns
3. Click any preset to automatically apply it
4. Modify the preset pattern for your specific needs
5. Test against your own data to verify accuracy

### Advanced Features

### Tips for Effective Usage

#### Pattern Development Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic patterns and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each component before combining patterns
3. **Use Anchors**: Apply `^` and `$` for precise matching boundaries
4. **Consider Performance**: Avoid catastrophic backtracking with complex patterns
5. **Document Groups**: Use named groups for complex patterns with multiple captures
