## API Endpoints

### Invoice Management

```
POST /api/invoices              # Create new invoice
GET /api/invoices               # List user invoices
GET /api/invoices/:id           # Get specific invoice
PUT /api/invoices/:id           # Update invoice
DELETE /api/invoices/:id        # Delete invoice
POST /api/invoices/:id/send     # Send invoice via email
GET /api/invoices/:id/pdf       # Generate PDF
```

### Client Management

```
POST /api/clients               # Create new client
GET /api/clients                # List user clients
GET /api/clients/:id            # Get specific client
PUT /api/clients/:id            # Update client
DELETE /api/clients/:id         # Delete client
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- All invoice data belongs to the creating user
- Client information encrypted at rest
- No cross-tenant data access
- GDPR compliance for client data deletion

### Access Control

- User authentication required for all operations
- Invoice sharing via secure, time-limited links
- Client data access restricted to owner
