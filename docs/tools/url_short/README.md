## 🚀 Implementation Guide

### Quick Start for Developers

#### Basic Setup Process

```bash
# 1. Navigate to URL Shortener
toolspace.app/tools/url-short

# 2. Verify developer access
# Dev badge should be visible in interface

# 3. Create your first short URL
# Enter URL: https://example.com/very/long/path/to/resource
# Click "Shorten URL"
# Result: https://toolspace.app/u/abc123

# 4. Test the short URL
curl -I https://toolspace.app/u/abc123
# Should return 302 redirect to original URL

# 5. Check analytics
# Click count and last accessed time visible in interface
```

#### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
// ShareEnvelope Integration Example
import { ShareEnvelope } from "@toolspace/core";

// Automatic URL shortening in workflow
const processUrls = async (data: any) => {
  const envelope = new ShareEnvelope(data);

  // Extract URLs from various data types
  const urls = envelope.extractUrls();

  // Shorten URLs that exceed length threshold
  const shortenedUrls = await Promise.all(
    urls.map((url) => (url.length > 100 ? shortenUrl(url) : url))
  );

  // Replace URLs in original data
  return envelope.replaceUrls(shortenedUrls);
};

// Custom analytics integration
const trackUrlUsage = (shortCode: string) => {
  // Integration with external analytics
  analytics.track("url_access", {
    shortCode,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    source: "toolspace",
  });
