# T-ToolsPack v2 Documentation

Three enhanced micro-tools for instant productivity: JSON Doctor v2, Text Diff v2, and QR Maker v2.

## Overview

T-ToolsPack v2 represents the second iteration of three popular micro-tools, adding advanced features while maintaining the instant-win philosophy of the original versions.

## JSON Doctor v2

### Purpose
Validate, format, and query JSON data with advanced schema validation and JSONPath support.

### Features

#### 1. Validation & Repair (Tab 1)
- Real-time JSON validation as you type
- Auto-formatting with proper indentation
- Smart error detection and repair suggestions
- Common fixes:
  - Single quotes → double quotes
  - Python booleans (True/False) → JSON booleans (true/false)
  - Unquoted keys → properly quoted keys
  - Python None → JSON null
- Copy formatted JSON to clipboard
- Visual status indicators with animations

#### 2. Schema Validation (Tab 2)
- Validate JSON data against JSON Schema
- Support for:
  - Type checking (string, integer, number, boolean, array, object, null)
  - Required properties validation
  - String length constraints (minLength, maxLength)
  - Number range constraints (minimum, maximum)
  - Enum validation
  - Nested object and array validation
- Auto-generate schema from sample JSON data
- Detailed error reporting with path information
- Split-pane design for data and schema input

#### 3. JSONPath Query (Tab 3)
- Execute JSONPath expressions on JSON data
- Supported patterns:
  - Root access: `$`
  - Property access: `$.name`
  - Nested properties: `$.user.address.city`
  - Array index: `$.users[0]`
  - Array wildcard: `$.users[*]`
  - Property wildcard: `$.*`
  - Combined: `$.users[*].name`
- Quick example templates for common queries
- Get all available paths in JSON structure
- Syntax validation for JSONPath expressions
- Results displayed in formatted JSON

### Usage Examples

**Schema Validation Example:**
```json
// Data
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

// Schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name", "age"],
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
    "age": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 150},
    "email": {"type": "string"}
  }
}
```

**JSONPath Query Example:**
```json
// Data
{
  "users": [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
  ]
}

// Query: $.users[*].name
// Result: ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

### Implementation Details
- Logic files: `lib/tools/json_doctor/logic/schema_validator.dart`, `jsonpath_query.dart`
- Tests: `test/tools/json_doctor_test.dart`
- No external dependencies - pure Dart implementation

## Text Diff v2

### Purpose
Compare texts with multiple comparison modes including line-by-line, word-by-word, and three-way merge.

### Features

#### 1. Line Diff (Tab 1)
- Traditional line-by-line comparison
- Visual highlighting:
  - Green background for added lines
  - Red background for deleted lines
  - Neutral for unchanged lines
- Statistics panel showing:
  - Number of additions
  - Number of deletions
  - Similarity percentage
- Swap texts functionality
- Copy diff results
- Real-time comparison with debouncing

#### 2. Word Diff (Tab 2)
- Word-by-word granular comparison
- Preserves whitespace information
- Visual highlighting with inline display:
  - Green background for inserted words
  - Red background for deleted words
  - Orange background for changed words
  - No highlight for unchanged words
- Word-level statistics:
  - Word additions count
  - Word deletions count
  - Word-level similarity percentage
- Continuous text flow (not line-by-line)

#### 3. Three-Way Merge (Tab 3)
- Compare base version against two modified versions
- Three-column input layout:
  - Base Version (center)
  - Left Version (left column, blue header)
  - Right Version (right column, green header)
- Automatic conflict detection
- Conflict markers in output:
  - `<<<<<<< LEFT` - start of left version
  - `=======` - separator
  - `>>>>>>> RIGHT` - end of right version
- Visual status:
  - Green indicator for successful merge (no conflicts)
  - Orange indicator for conflicts detected
  - Conflict count displayed
- Use cases:
  - Merging code changes from different branches
  - Reconciling document edits from multiple sources
  - Understanding divergent changes from a common base

### Usage Examples

**Word Diff Example:**
- Original: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
- Modified: "The fast brown fox leaps over the sleepy dog"
- Diff shows: quick→fast (changed), jumps→leaps (changed), lazy→sleepy (changed)

**Three-Way Merge Example:**
- Base: "Hello world"
- Left: "Hello beautiful world"
- Right: "Hello world everyone"
- Result: "Hello beautiful world everyone" (no conflicts)

- Base: "Hello world"
- Left: "Hello universe"
- Right: "Hello planet"
- Result shows conflict markers (both changed the same word differently)

### Implementation Details
- Logic file: `lib/tools/text_diff/logic/word_diff_engine.dart`
- Tests: `test/tools/text_diff_logic_test.dart`
- Algorithms:
  - Word splitting with whitespace preservation
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for diff calculation
  - Custom three-way merge with conflict detection
