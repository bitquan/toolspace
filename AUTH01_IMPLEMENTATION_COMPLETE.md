# AUTH-01 Sprint Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 8, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
**Branch:** `feat/auth01-security-gates`

---

## 🎯 Objective

Turn all 52 security tests green by implementing production-ready authentication, security rules, billing integration, and quota enforcement.

---

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Auth UI & Flows (Tasks 1)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What Was Implemented:**

- ✅ Session persistence with `Persistence.LOCAL` in auth service initialization
- ✅ Email validation with proper regex (`isValidEmail` method)
- ✅ Password validation: min 8 chars, uppercase, number (`isValidPassword`, `getPasswordError` methods)
- ✅ Anonymous account linking in signup flow with `linkWithCredential`
- ✅ Email verification enforcement via `RequireVerifiedEmailGuard`
- ✅ All auth screens already exist: signin, signup, password reset, email verification, account

**Files Modified:**

- `lib/auth/services/auth_service.dart` - Added `setPersistence`, `isValidEmail`, `isValidPassword`, `getPasswordError`
- `lib/auth/screens/signup_screen.dart` - Added anonymous linking logic with `EmailAuthProvider.credential`
- `lib/auth/screens/signin_screen.dart` - Updated email validator to use `isValidEmail`

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ `auth.e2e.spec.ts` - All 6 tests should pass (3 were failing)
  - Complete auth flow: signup → verify → login → logout
  - Password reset flow
  - Email verification enforcement
  - Email format validation
  - Password strength validation

---

### 2. Anonymous Linking (Task 2)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What Was Implemented:**

- ✅ `linkAnonymousAccount` method already exists in `AuthService`
- ✅ Signup flow checks `authService.isAnonymous` and calls `linkAnonymousAccount` with email/password credential
- ✅ UID preservation: Firebase's `linkWithCredential` automatically preserves the anonymous UID
- ✅ Data migration: Firestore security rules ensure all user data is scoped to `users/{uid}`, so data automatically migrates with the preserved UID

**Files Modified:**

- `lib/auth/screens/signup_screen.dart` - Added anonymous linking flow

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ `link-anon.e2e.spec.ts` - All 3 tests should pass (2 were failing)
  - Anonymous → signed up flow with UID persistence
  - Anonymous can create usage document
  - Anonymous UID is unique and persistent

---

### 3. Security Rules Lockdown (Task 3)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What Was Implemented:**

- ✅ Firestore rules: Already locked down with owner-only access, deny unauthenticated
- ✅ Storage rules: Updated to 200MB file size limit (was 10MB), added temp directory support
- ✅ All collections require authentication: `users/{uid}`, `users/{uid}/billing/**`, `users/{uid}/usage/**`
- ✅ Public assets read-only, merged files write-protected (only functions can write)

**Files Modified:**

- `storage.rules` - Updated file size limits to 200MB, added temp directory, expanded allowed content types

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ `firestore.rules.test.ts` - All 21 tests should pass
  - Deny unauthenticated read/write
  - Allow owner-only access
  - Deny cross-user access
- ✅ `storage.rules.test.ts` - All 11 tests should pass
  - Deny unauthenticated upload/read
  - Allow owner-only access
  - Enforce 200MB file size limits
  - Temp directory isolation

---

### 4. Functions Auth Middleware (Task 4)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

**What Was Found:**

- ✅ `withAuth` middleware already exists and verifies Firebase ID tokens
- ✅ `withOwnership` middleware validates resource ownership
- ✅ `withEmailVerification` requires verified email
- ✅ All billing endpoints (`createCheckoutSession`, `createPortalLink`, webhook) already protected
- ✅ Tests already exist in `functions/src/middleware/__tests__/withAuth.test.ts`

**Files Checked:**

- `functions/src/middleware/withAuth.ts` - Full implementation found
- `functions/src/billing/index.ts` - All endpoints wrapped with auth middleware

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ Middleware tests should all pass (already passing)
- ✅ Billing endpoints reject unauthenticated requests

---

### 5. Stripe Linking & Persistence (Task 5)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

**What Was Found:**

- ✅ `createCheckoutSession` sets `client_reference_id = userId` for cross-device access
- ✅ `createCheckoutSession` sets `metadata.userId`, `metadata.firebaseUid`, and `subscription_data.metadata.userId`
- ✅ Webhook handler `handleCheckoutCompleted` updates customer metadata with Firebase UID
- ✅ `handleSubscriptionUpdated` writes to `users/{uid}/billing/profile` in Firestore
- ✅ Subscription plan persists across sessions via Firestore profile
- ✅ `handleSubscriptionDeleted` handles cancellations and downgrades

**Files Checked:**

- `functions/src/billing/createCheckoutSession.ts` - UID linking implemented
- `functions/src/billing/webhook.ts` - Full webhook lifecycle handling
- `lib/billing/billing_service.dart` - Stream-based profile updates

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ `billing-link.e2e.spec.ts` - All 4 tests should pass (3 were failing)
  - Webhook updates billing profile
  - Plan persists across browser sessions
  - Subscription cancellation downgrades user
  - Webhook signature validation

---

### 6. Paywall + Quotas (Task 6)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

**What Was Found:**

- ✅ `PaywallGuard` widget fully implemented with quota checks
- ✅ `canPerformHeavyOp()` enforces daily limits (3 for Free, unlimited for Pro/Pro+)
- ✅ `trackHeavyOp()` increments usage counter in `users/{uid}/usage/{yyyy-mm-dd}`
- ✅ Usage tracking with Firestore transactions for atomicity
- ✅ Daily reset: Usage documents keyed by date (`yyyy-mm-dd`), auto-creates new doc each day
- ✅ `UpgradeSheet` shown when limits exceeded
- ✅ `QuotaBanner` shown when approaching limits (20% threshold)
- ✅ Debug mode bypass for emulator testing (`kDebugMode` check)

**Files Checked:**

- `lib/billing/widgets/paywall_guard.dart` - Full implementation
- `lib/billing/billing_service.dart` - Quota tracking methods
- `lib/billing/billing_types.dart` - Entitlements configuration

**Expected Test Results:**

- ✅ `tools-gating.e2e.spec.ts` - All 7 tests should pass (5 were failing)
  - Free user blocked after 3 heavy ops
  - Pro user unlimited access
  - Quota increments correctly
  - Upgrade flow unlocks tools

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Session Persistence

```dart
// lib/auth/services/auth_service.dart
await _auth.setPersistence(Persistence.LOCAL);
```

### Email/Password Validation

```dart
// Regex for email: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
bool isValidEmail(String email) => emailRegex.hasMatch(email.trim());

// Password: min 8 chars, uppercase, number
bool isValidPassword(String password) {
  if (password.length < 8) return false;
  return password.contains(RegExp(r'[A-Z]')) &&
         password.contains(RegExp(r'[0-9]'));
}
```

### Anonymous Linking

```dart
// lib/auth/screens/signup_screen.dart
if (authService.isAnonymous) {
  final credential = EmailAuthProvider.credential(
    email: email,
    password: password,
  );
  await authService.linkAnonymousAccount(credential);
}
```

### Quota Enforcement

```dart
// lib/billing/billing_service.dart
Future<EntitlementCheckResult> canPerformHeavyOp() async {
  final usage = await getTodayUsage();
  final entitlements = await getEntitlements(profile.planId);

  if (usage.heavyOps >= entitlements.heavyOpsPerDay) {
    return EntitlementCheckResult(
      allowed: false,
      reason: 'Daily heavy operation limit reached',
    );
  }
  return EntitlementCheckResult(allowed: true);
}
```

### Daily Reset

Usage documents are keyed by date: `users/{uid}/usage/2025-01-08`

- New day = new document automatically created
- No scheduled function needed
- Timezone: UTC (based on Firestore server timestamp)

## 📝 Manual Testing Steps

### Test User Credentials (Stripe Test Mode)

- **Test Email:** `test-auth01@toolspace.com`
- **Test Password:** `TestPass123!`
- **Test Card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Visa)
- **Expiry:** Any future date
- **CVC:** Any 3 digits

### Test Flow

1. **Sign Up:**

   - Go to `/auth/signup`
   - Enter email/password (must meet validation: 8+ chars, uppercase, number)
   - Click "Sign Up" → redirected to `/auth/verify`

2. **Email Verification:**

   - Check Firebase emulator console for verification email
   - Click verification link (or use admin SDK in emulator)
   - Return to app, login

3. **Anonymous Linking:**

   - Start as anonymous user (app auto-signs in anonymously)
   - Create URL shortener entry
   - Go to `/auth/signup`, create account
   - Verify UID preserved and URL entry still accessible

4. **Quota Testing:**

   - Login as Free user
   - Use File Merger 3 times (heavy tool)
   - 4th attempt should show "Daily limit reached" error
   - Upgrade to Pro → unlimited access immediately

5. **Billing Integration:**

   - Go to billing/upgrade
   - Select Pro plan
   - Complete Stripe checkout (test mode)
   - Webhook should update profile in Firestore
   - Reload page → Pro features unlocked
   - Open new browser (different profile) → still Pro

6. **Cancellation:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard (test mode), cancel subscription
   - Webhook fires → billing profile updated to Free
   - App reflects downgrade immediately

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

### Debug Mode Bypass

- `PaywallGuard` allows all access when `kDebugMode = true`
- This is **intentional** for emulator testing
- In production build (`flutter build web --release`), `kDebugMode = false` and quotas are enforced

### Emulator Email Verification

- Firebase Auth emulator doesn't actually send emails
- Verification emails logged to console
- For E2E tests, mock verification or use admin SDK

### Daily Reset Timing

- Usage documents keyed by `yyyy-mm-dd` format
- Reset happens at UTC midnight
- No timezone conversion currently implemented
- Consider adding user timezone preference if needed

## 🔗 CI Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/auth-security-ok.yml`

**Jobs:**

1. `rules-test` - Firestore + Storage rules tests
2. `auth-e2e` - Authentication E2E tests
3. `link-anon-e2e` - Anonymous linking tests
4. `billing-link-e2e` - Billing webhook tests
5. `tools-gating` - Tools gating and quota tests
6. `auth-security-ok` - Composite check (all must pass)

**Deployment Gate:**

- `firebase-hosting-merge.yml` now requires `check-security` job
- Checks that latest `auth-security-ok` workflow succeeded
- Blocks deployment if security tests fail
