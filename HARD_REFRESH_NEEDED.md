# 🔍 White Screen Debug Steps

## Current Status

- ✅ App compiles with no errors
- ✅ Landing page widgets have no errors (only style suggestions)
- ✅ Routing configured correctly: `/` → `LandingPage`
- ✅ Firebase initializing properly
- ❌ Browser showing white screen

## The Problem

The app is still showing a white screen because **the browser has cached the old broken version**.

## Solution: Hard Refresh Required

### Windows / Linux (Chrome/Edge)

Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** or **Ctrl + F5**

### Mac (Chrome)

Press **Cmd + Shift + R**

### Alternative: Clear Cache

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Or: Close and Reopen

1. Close the browser tab completely
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:51268` (or your port)
3. The app should load fresh

## What a Hard Refresh Does

- Clears cached JavaScript
- Clears cached CSS
- Forces browser to download fresh app
- Bypasses service worker cache

## After Hard Refresh, You Should See:

```
🏠 Landing Page
├── Navigation Bar (Toolspace logo, Dashboard, Sign In, Get Started)
├── Hero Section ("Build Smarter, Ship Faster")
│   ├── Animated floating icons
│   ├── Get Started Free button
│   └── View Dashboard button
├── Features Grid (5 tool cards)
├── Pricing Section (3 plans: Free, Pro, Pro+)
├── Social Proof (stats, testimonials, trust badges)
└── Footer (4 columns with links)
```

## If Still White After Hard Refresh

Check browser console (F12 → Console tab) for errors and share them with me. Look for:

- Red error messages
- Failed network requests
- JavaScript exceptions

---

## Quick Test: Navigate Manually

Try going directly to the dashboard:

- Type in address bar: `http://localhost:51268/#/dashboard`
- If dashboard shows, routing works
- Then navigate back: click Home button
