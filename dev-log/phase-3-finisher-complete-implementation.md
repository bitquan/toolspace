## Technical Architecture

### ShareBus System

- **Pattern:** Singleton event bus with ChangeNotifier
- **TTL Management:** 5-minute default with automatic cleanup
- **Data Types:** Text, JSON, CSV, Markdown, File URLs, Data URLs, Images
- **Performance:** Queue-based with selective retrieval optimization

### Cross-Tool Data Flow

```
Tool A → ShareToolbar → ShareBus → ShareEnvelope → Tool B
```

### Persistence Layer

- **ShareBus:** In-memory with TTL expiry
- **HandoffStore:** Firebase Firestore with 24-hour TTL
- **User Isolation:** Authentication-based data segregation

### Testing Framework

- **E2E Playground:** Development-only testing environment
- **Automated Flows:** Pre-programmed multi-tool workflows
- **Manual Testing:** Quick data seeding and verification
- **Monitoring:** Real-time ShareBus status visualization

## Routes Integration

Successfully integrated all new components into the routing system:

**New Routes Added:**

- `/tools/invoice-lite` - Invoice Lite tool
- `/tools/audio-converter` - Audio Converter tool
- `/tools/file-compressor` - File Compressor tool
- `/billing/success` - Billing success page
- `/billing/cancel` - Billing cancellation page
- `/dev/e2e-playground` - E2E testing playground

## Performance Considerations

### ShareBus Optimization

- Automatic TTL cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Selective data retrieval methods for efficiency
- Listener management in widget lifecycle
- Large file handling via URL references

### User Experience

- Progressive enhancement (core features work without premium)
- Graceful degradation for billing failures
- Real-time feedback for data sharing operations
- Clear visual indicators for cross-tool capabilities

## Security Implementation

### Data Protection

- User-specific data isolation via authentication
- TTL enforcement for sensitive data expiry
- Firebase security rules preventing cross-user access
- No sensitive data in client-side envelope metadata

### Billing Security

- Server-side subscription validation
- Stripe webhook verification
- Client-side UI enforcement with server-side backup
- Regular validation against source of truth

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** 19 ShareBus tests (100% pass rate)
- **Integration Tests:** Cross-tool data flows validated
- **E2E Tests:** Automated workflow verification
- **Manual Testing:** Comprehensive checklist procedures

### Code Quality

- **Linting:** Dart analyze compliance (minor style warnings only)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive API and architecture docs
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks throughout system
- **Performance:** Optimized for production deployment

## Deployment Readiness
