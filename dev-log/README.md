### When to Log

#### Always Log

- Major feature releases
- Critical bug fixes
- Security updates
- Infrastructure changes
- Breaking changes

#### Consider Logging

- Performance improvements
- Quality improvements
- Process changes
- Tool updates

### Quality Assurance Logs

Store QA artifacts in `quality/logs/`:

- `qa-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.json` - QA run results
- `coverage-YYYY-MM-DD.html` - Coverage reports
- `security-scan-YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Security scan results
- `performance-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - Performance benchmarks

### Operations Logs

Store operational records in `operations/`:

- `deployment-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Deployment records
- `incident-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Incident reports
- `maintenance-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Maintenance activities

## Automation

Some logs are generated automatically:

- CI/CD pipeline results
- Automated test reports
- Security scan outputs
- Performance monitoring data

## Retention Policy

- Keep all logs for at least 1 year
- Archive older logs annually
- Critical incidents: permanent retention
- Regular cleanup of temporary files

## Access and Privacy

- Development team has full access
- Sensitive information should be redacted
- External stakeholders get filtered access
- Comply with data retention policies

This log system ensures transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in our development process.
