# OPS-LocalGate Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Type:** Operations / Quality Gate  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Summary

Implemented OPS-LocalGate, a comprehensive pre-push validation system that enforces local testing before allowing any git push. This eliminates "push-and-pray" workflows and ensures local development parity with CI.

## What Changed

### 1. Preflight Script (`scripts/preflight.mjs`)

Created a comprehensive Node.js ESM script that runs:

- **Tooling checks**: Verifies Flutter, Dart, Node.js, npm, Firebase CLI availability
- **Flutter app**: `pub get`, `analyze`, `test --coverage`, `build web` (optional)
- **Functions**: `npm ci`, `lint`, `test`
- **Security & E2E**: Firestore rules + optional Playwright smoke tests

**Features:**
- Fail-fast with clear error messages
- Logging to `local-ci/logs/*.log`
- Markdown summary at `local-ci/summary.md`
- Flags: `--quick`, `--no-emulators`, `--fix`

### 2. Pre-Push Hook (Husky)

- Installed Husky 9
- Created `.husky/pre-push` that runs `npm run preflight`
- Every `git push` is blocked if checks fail
- Can bypass with `--no-verify` (emergency only)

### 3. Package.json Updates

Added scripts:
```json
{
  "preflight": "node scripts/preflight.mjs",
  "preflight:quick": "node scripts/preflight.mjs --quick",
  "setup:hooks": "husky install"
}
```

Added devDependencies:
- `husky@9` - Git hooks
- `zx@7` - Shell scripting helpers
- `colorette@2` - Terminal colors
- `execa@9` - Process execution
- `tree-kill@1` - Process cleanup
- `@actions/core@1` - GitHub Actions utilities

### 4. VS Code Integration

Added two tasks to `.vscode/tasks.json`:
- "Preflight: All checks (local == CI)" - Full suite
- "Preflight (quick)" - Fast validation

### 5. Documentation

Created:
- `docs/ops/local-gate.md` - Complete usage guide
- Updated `README.md` Contributing section
- This dev-log entry

Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `local-ci/` directory.

## Expected Runtime

| Mode | Duration | What Runs |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Full** | ~3-5 min | All checks + web build + E2E |
| **Quick** | ~1-2 min | Core checks only |

## Usage

### First Time Setup
```bash
npm install        # Install devDeps (husky, zx, etc.)
npm run setup:hooks # Install Husky hooks
```

### Regular Workflow
```bash
# Make changes...
npm run preflight  # or preflight:quick

# If green, push automatically triggers preflight
git push  # Pre-push hook runs preflight
```

### Flags
```bash
npm run preflight         # Full suite
npm run preflight:quick   # Skip web build + Playwright
node scripts/preflight.mjs --fix  # Auto-fix linting
```

## Impact

### Benefits
✅ **No broken pushes**: All code is validated locally before push  
✅ **Local == CI**: Same checks run locally and in CI  
✅ **Clear feedback**: Detailed logs show exactly what failed  
✅ **Fast feedback**: Quick mode runs in ~1-2 minutes  
✅ **Developer confidence**: Know your code is good before pushing  

### Tradeoffs
⚠️ **Slower pushes**: Must wait for checks (use `--quick` for speed)  
⚠️ **Initial setup**: Requires `npm install` + `setup:hooks`  
⚠️ **Can be bypassed**: `--no-verify` exists but should only be for emergencies  

## CI Alignment

The same `preflight.mjs` script can be used in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: 🔒 Preflight checks
  run: node scripts/preflight.mjs --quick
```

This ensures identical behavior between local and CI environments.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add `--parallel` flag to run independent checks concurrently
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook for faster feedback (lint + format only)
- [ ] Add caching for Flutter/npm dependencies to speed up checks
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking to track check duration over time
- [ ] Integrate with VS Code testing UI for better UX

## Philosophy

> "If it doesn't pass locally, it shouldn't leave your machine."

The Local Gate enforces this principle. All pushes must be green before they can reach the remote repository.
