# CSV Cleaner Tool Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Author**: GitHub Copilot Agent  
**Type**: Feature Implementation  
**Status**: Completed  

## Description

Implemented a comprehensive CSV Cleaner tool for the Toolspace platform. The tool allows users to upload CSV files, clean and normalize the data through various operations, and export the cleaned results.

## Changes Made

### Core Logic (`lib/tools/csv_cleaner/logic/csv_processor.dart`)

- **CSV Parsing**: Implemented robust CSV parser with support for:
  - Comma-delimited values
  - Quoted fields containing commas and newlines
  - Escaped quotes (`""` becomes `"`)
  - Empty line handling
  
- **Cleaning Operations**:
  - `trimWhitespace()`: Removes leading/trailing whitespace from all cells
  - `lowercaseHeaders()`: Converts first row (headers) to lowercase
  - `removeDuplicates()`: Removes duplicate rows with optional key column selection
  - `cleanAll()`: Applies multiple operations in sequence
  
- **Validation**: Column count consistency checking across all rows
- **Export**: CSV generation with proper escaping for special characters

### UI (`lib/tools/csv_cleaner/csv_cleaner_screen.dart`)

- **Empty State**: Upload prompt with clear instructions
- **Loading State**: Progress indicator during file parsing
- **Data View**: 
  - Interactive DataTable with horizontal/vertical scrolling
  - File info display (name, dimensions)
  - Action buttons for operations
  
- **Operations**:
  - Trim Whitespace button
  - Lowercase Headers button
  - Remove Duplicates with column selection dialog
  - Export CSV (to clipboard)
  - Upload New File
  - Clear Data
  
- **Feedback**:
  - Success snackbars for completed operations
  - Error messages for invalid files
  - Operation result counts (e.g., "Removed 5 duplicate rows")

### Navigation

- Added CSV Cleaner to home screen tools grid
- Icon: `Icons.table_rows`
- Position: 6th tool in the grid
- Route: `/tools/csv-cleaner`

### Tests

**Unit Tests** (`test/tools/csv_cleaner/csv_processor_test.dart`):
- CSV parsing (simple, quoted values, escaped quotes, empty lines)
- CSV generation with proper escaping
- Trim whitespace operation
- Lowercase headers operation
- Remove duplicates (entire row and by key column)
- Validation (empty CSV, inconsistent columns)
- Clean all operations
- Total: 20+ test cases

**Widget Tests** (`test/tools/csv_cleaner/csv_cleaner_widget_test.dart`):
- Empty state display
- Upload button presence
- App bar title
- UI element rendering

### Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation (`docs/tools/csv-cleaner.md`):
- Feature overview
- Usage instructions
- API reference
- Examples with before/after CSV samples
- Technical details
- Testing guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancements

## Impact

### User Benefits

1. **Data Quality**: Quick cleanup of messy CSV files
2. **Consistency**: Standardized header formatting
3. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate entries efficiently
4. **Productivity**: No need for spreadsheet software for simple cleaning tasks
5. **Privacy**: All processing happens client-side, no data uploaded to servers

### Technical Benefits

1. **Code Reusability**: CSV processor can be used by other tools
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability
3. **Documentation**: Clear examples and API reference
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of logic and UI

## Technical Decisions

### Why Not Use a CSV Library?

Implemented custom CSV parser to:
- Avoid adding external dependencies
- Keep bundle size small
- Have full control over parsing behavior
- Maintain consistency with project patterns

The parser handles the most common CSV scenarios. For advanced use cases (custom delimiters, different encodings), users can pre-process with external tools.

### Why Clipboard Export?

- Simplest cross-platform solution
- No file system permissions needed
- Works in web and mobile contexts
- Users can paste into any application

Future enhancement: Add direct file download for desktop/web.

### Key Column Deduplication

Provided flexible deduplication:
- Entire row: Useful for complete duplicates
- By key column: Useful when some columns may differ (e.g., timestamps)

This covers the most common use cases without overcomplicating the UI.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed

✅ Upload valid CSV file  
✅ Upload invalid CSV file (shows error)  
✅ Upload CSV with quoted values and commas  
✅ Trim whitespace operation  
✅ Lowercase headers operation  
✅ Remove duplicates by entire row  
✅ Remove duplicates by key column  
✅ Export to clipboard  
✅ Clear data and upload new file  
✅ UI responsiveness with large files (tested 100+ rows)  

### CI Pipeline

All changes will be validated by CI:
- Dart format check
- Flutter analyze
- Unit tests
- Widget tests
- Coverage report

## Next Steps

### Required for Completion
- ✅ Code implementation
- ✅ Tests written
- ✅ Documentation created
- ⏳ CI pipeline validation
- ⏳ PR review and merge

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
