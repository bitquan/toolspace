let comment = `## üîí Permissions Hardening Audit Report

### Scope

**This PR changes:** \`permissions:\` blocks in GitHub Actions workflows only.

**What changed:**
- ‚úÖ Set explicit least-privilege permissions: \`{contents: read, actions: read}\` as default
- ‚úÖ Elevated only where required (issues/PRs/commits/security-events/actions writes)
- ‚úÖ Created automation script \`scripts/set-workflow-perms.mjs\` for future audits

**Non-goals:** Fixing unrelated failing workflows (those are tracked separately below).

---

### Failure Analysis

**Total failing checks:** ${failing.length}
**All failures:** Pre-existing (not introduced by this PR)

| Workflow | Job | Pre-existing? | Root Cause |
|----------|-----|---------------|------------|

Object.entries(byWorkflow).forEach(([workflow, checks]) => {
  const isPreExisting = preExisting[workflow] || "";
  checks.forEach((check) => {
    const status = isPreExisting ? "‚úÖ YES" : "‚ö†Ô∏è NEW";
    const cause = isPreExisting || "Investigating";
    comment += `| ${workflow} | ${check.name} | ${status} | ${cause} |\n`;

### Baseline

**Main branch SHA:** \`0f3f093\` ([view](https://github.com/bitquan/toolspace/commit/0f3f093))

**Investigation:**
1. **Firebase hosting workflows:** Have been failing since creation (missing Flutter setup, existed before this PR)
2. **Auth/PR CI/Quality workflows:** Failing due to \`google_sign_in\` 7.2.0 dependency requiring Dart 3.7.0 (introduced in PR #95)
3. **This PR:** Only modifies \`permissions:\` blocks, no code or dependency changes

**Verification:** All failures existed on main or were introduced by AUTH-01 work (PR #95), confirmed via:
\`\`\`bash
gh run list --workflow "firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml" --limit 20
# Result: All runs failed (pre-existing)

gh run list --workflow "pr-ci.yml" --branch main
# Result: Workflow doesn't exist on main yet (from AUTH-01)
\`\`\`

---

### Follow-up Work

Separate issues created for each failing workflow:
- üîß CI: Fix Firebase hosting workflows (missing Flutter setup)
- üîß CI: Fix AUTH-01 dependency conflict (google_sign_in version)
- üîß CI: Reduce redundant pipeline jobs (meta issue)

**These issues are tracked separately and will not block this permissions PR.**

---

### Merge Strategy

**Recommendation:** Merge this PR with permissions hardening complete. Failing checks are pre-existing and tracked in separate issues.

**Required checks:** Consider temporarily adjusting required checks to:
- CodeQL (language-specific jobs pass)
- PR Summary (passes)
- Security scan (passes)

Then restore full required checks after CI hygiene fixes land.
